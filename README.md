MaterialList is an Android library created to help all Android developers get the beautiful CardViews that Google shows at its [official design specifications](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/cards.html#cards-usage).

Provided as a RecyclerView extension, it can receive a list of Cards (stored in a CardList, provided by the library) and show them accordingly to the android style and design patterns.

It also has been developed while keeping extensibility in mind, which means that you are able to create your own card layouts and add them to the CardList without any pain (see examples below).

## Cards provided
These are the cards that the library offers by default:

For further documentation, you can [check the Wiki page](https://github.com/dexafree/MaterialList/wiki/).

## How to use

The MaterialListView is based on a RecyclerView. It acts just as a normal ListView, but offering options for interacting with your cards. It can display the cards in a single or multiple columns.

### 1. Step: Declare a MaterialListView in your layout

```xml
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:paddingLeft="@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin"
    android:paddingRight="@dimen/activity_horizontal_margin"
    android:paddingTop="@dimen/activity_vertical_margin"
    android:paddingBottom="@dimen/activity_vertical_margin">

    <com.dexafree.materialList.view.MaterialListView
        android:layout_width="fill_parent"
        android:layout_height="fill_parent"
        android:id="@+id/material_listview"/>

</RelativeLayout>
```

There are also some additional attributes to define the column count of the MaterialListView. Therefore you need

```xml
xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
```

You can use the **column_count** attribute for using a fixed column count in portrait and landscape mode.

```xml
    app:column_count="1"
```

Or you can use the **column_count_portrait** and **column_count_landscape** attributes.

```xml
    app:column_count_portrait="1"
    app:column_count_landscape="2"
```

### 2. Step: Find your MaterialListView in code

```java
MaterialListView mListView = (MaterialListView) findViewById(R.id.material_listview);
```

### 3. Step: Add Cards to the MaterialListView

```java
Card card = new Card.Builder(this)
                            .setTag("BASIC_IMAGE_BUTTONS_CARD")
                            .withProvider(BasicImageButtonsCardProvider.class)
                            .setTitle("I'm new")
                            .setDescription("I've been generated on runtime!")
                            .setDrawable(R.drawable.dog)
                            .endConfig()
                            .build()

mListView.getAdapter().(card);
```

There are also some Cards that may show a Divider between the content and the buttons. For further reference, [read the Wiki page](https://github.com/dexafree/MaterialList/wiki/Dividers)

## Clicking the cards
As the project was migrated from `ListView` to `RecyclerView`, it did not offer the native `OnItemClickListener` / `OnItemLongClickListener` methods that can be accessed from ListView.

Since version 2.4.0, you can add your listeners

```java
mListView.addOnItemTouchListener(new RecyclerItemClickListener.OnItemClickListener() {

    @Override
    public void onItemClick(Card card, int position) {
        Log.d("CARD_TYPE", card.getTag().toString());
    }

    @Override
    public void onItemLongClick(Card card, int position) {
        Log.d("LONG_CLICK", card.getTag().toString());
    }
});
```

Check also the **Recovering data from the cards** section in order to be able to recover the Card's content

## Dismissing the cards
One of the features I've always loved is the SwipeToDismiss gesture.
MaterialList brings you this feature, and in order to set a callback to the dismissing action, you only need to create your own OnDismissCallback:

```java
mListView.setOnDismissCallback(new OnDismissCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onDismiss(Card card, int position) {
        // Do whatever you want here
    }
});
```
You will also be able to decide if a card should be dismissible or not, just by calling Card.setCanDismiss().

Check also the **Recovering data from the cards** section in order to be able to recover the Card's content


## Recovering data from the cards
You can check [the Wiki page in order to get more information about the tag system](https://github.com/dexafree/MaterialList/wiki/Recovering-data-from-the-Cards).


## Animations
Since version 2.0, MaterialList provides animations, in order to enhance cards apparitions.

You can implement them just by calling the [setItemAnimator(RecyclerView.ItemAnimator animator)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html#setItemAnimator(android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView.ItemAnimator) "Android Developer Documentation") method.

There also exists an extensive [animation library for the RecyclerView from wasabeef](https://github.com/wasabeef/recyclerview-animators).

## Extensibility
MaterialList was created with extensibility in mind, so it makes things easy for you if you want to create your own Cards.

For learning how to do it, [check the Wiki page](https://github.com/dexafree/MaterialList/wiki/Create-your-own-Cards)

## Compatibility
MaterialList is compatible with Android 2.3+

## How to use
In order to use MaterialList, you can either clone the project and import it as a module, or you can add this line to your build.gradle script:

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.github.dexafree:materiallist:3.1.3'
}
```

## Sample
You can clone the project and compile it yourself (it includes a sample), or you can check it out already compiled at Google Play
